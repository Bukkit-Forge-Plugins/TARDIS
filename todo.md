# TODO
1. Check what happens when companions use the TARDIS with regards to:
   - Artron Energy
   - Materialising
   - Recharging
2. Update schematic dimensions so all rooms have their own dimensions
   - Still undecided whether we should allow players to use their own room schematics until we know it works OK
3. Look at doing a Tekkit version
   - or remove anything that would make it incompatible
4. Update help
   - add bind command
6. Do a whole bunch of tutorial videos
