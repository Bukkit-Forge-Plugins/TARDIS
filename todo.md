# TODO
1. If WorldGuard is installed, automatically protect the 3x3 region around a recharging beacon.
2. Decrease materialsation time?
3. Check what happens when companions use the TARDIS with regards to:

4. Update schematic dimensions so all rooms have their own dimensions
   - Still undecided whether we should allow/can actually let players use their own room schematics
5. Do a whole bunch of tutorial videos
6. TEST, TEST, TEST

#Minecraft API when available
1. Create custom blocks for the tardis box and console.
