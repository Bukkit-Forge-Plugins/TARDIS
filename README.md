TARDIS
======
<<<<<<< HEAD
TARDIS is a CraftBukkit plugin that allows you to create a TARDIS that lets you time travel (teleport) to random locations. It adds a Whovian twist to the typical /sethome and /home commands.

As a player, you can:
* Create a TARDIS that is bigger on the inside.
* Time travel to a random location.
* Time travel back home (where you created the TARDIS initially).
* Save and list interesting time travel locations, so you can return to them easily.             
=======

A plugin for all Doctor Who fans - create and use a TARDIS! Teleport to random destinations, fight randomly spawning monsters - it's bigger on the inside!
